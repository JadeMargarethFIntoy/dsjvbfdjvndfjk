<h2><dd>The water cycle is a biochemical cycle that involve the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the earth.</dd>
    <dd>The mass of water on earth remains fairly constant overtime. However the paritioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice,</dd>
	<dd>fresh water, salt water, and atmospheric water is variable and depends on climatic variables.</dd>
	
  </p>
    <dd>Evaporation is a type of vaporization that occurs on the surface of a liquid as it changes into the gas phase.</dd>
	<dd>Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase, and it cools the</dd> 
	<dd>water vapor into the atmosphere to form clouds. Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes</dd>
	<dd>saturated with water vapor reaching 100% relative humidity so that the water condenses and precipitates or falls.</dd>
	<dd>Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil.</dd>
	<dd>Runoff is the unconfined flow of water over the ground surface.</dd>
